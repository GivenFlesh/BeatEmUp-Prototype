# BeatEmUp-Prototype

This is a project I'm trying out to see if I can help a friend make a small beat em up game.

I am new at coding so this is mostly public just to share with friends and family.

It is being made in unity version 2021.2.7f1

Download that version of the Unity Editor via unity hub, download the zip and place it where you want to check on the project, and then 'add' in the top right corner of hub to locate the folder. It should download all the necessary project files from Unity.
